## Part 5: Sample Essays / 范文

### 5.1 Task 1 Sample (Line Graph)
*Topic: The graph below shows the consumption of fish and some different kinds of meat in a European country between 1979 and 2004.*

The line graph **illustrates** the changes in the amount of fish and meat consumed in a European country **over a period of** 25 years from 1979 to 2004.

**Overall, it is clear that** the consumption of chicken showed an upward trend, **while** the popularity of beef and lamb declined **significantly**. Fish consumption, **by comparison**, remained relatively stable.

**In 1979**, beef was the most popular meat, with **approximately** 220 grams eaten per person per week. **However**, this figure **dropped dramatically** to around 100 grams by 2004. **Similarly**, lamb consumption started at 150 grams and **experienced a steady decline**, ending the period at just over 50 grams.

**In contrast**, chicken consumption **saw a remarkable increase**. Starting at roughly 140 grams in 1979, it **surpassed** lamb in 1980 and beef in 1989, eventually **peaking at** 250 grams in 2004. **As for** fish, the consumption **fluctuated slightly** but **remained roughly unchanged** at around 50 grams throughout the period.

> **中文翻译:**
> 这张折线图展示了1979年至2004年25年间某欧洲国家鱼肉和肉类消费量的变化。
>
> **总的来说，很明显**鸡肉的消费量呈上升趋势，**而**牛肉和羊肉的受欢迎程度**显著**下降。**相比之下**，鱼肉的消费量保持相对稳定。
>
> **1979年**，牛肉是最受欢迎的肉类，每人每周食用**约**220克。**然而**，这一数字到2004年**急剧下降**至100克左右。**同样地**，羊肉消费量从150克开始，**经历了稳步下降**，期末仅略高于50克。
>
> **相反**，鸡肉消费量**显着增加**。1979年开始时约为140克，1980年**超过**羊肉，1989年超过牛肉，最终在2004年**达到顶峰**250克。**至于**鱼肉，消费量**轻微波动**，但在此期间**基本保持不变**，约为50克。

### 5.2 Task 2 Sample (Agree/Disagree)
*Topic: Some people think that the best way to increase road safety is to increase the minimum legal age for driving cars or riding motorbikes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?*

Traffic accidents are a major concern globally. **It is often suggested that** raising the minimum driving age is the most effective method to improve road safety. **While** I accept that young drivers can be reckless, I believe that better training and stricter penalties are more effective solutions.

**On the one hand**, raising the driving age could reduce accidents **to some extent**. **This is due to the fact that** younger people are often more impulsive and less experienced than older drivers. **For example**, statistics often show that drivers under 20 are involved in more high-speed crashes. **Therefore**, banning them from the road until they are older might save lives.

**However**, simply changing the age limit does not guarantee better driving skills. **In my opinion**, a lack of proper training is the root cause of accidents. **If** new drivers, regardless of age, undergo rigorous testing, they will be safer on the roads. **For instance**, including mandatory hazard perception tests and night driving hours in the curriculum would be more beneficial. **In addition to this**, stricter penalties for traffic violations would deter bad driving habits.

**Furthermore**, raising the age limit would be unfair to responsible young people who need vehicles for work or education. **Considering that** public transport is not always reliable, denying them the right to drive could hinder their independence and career prospects.

**In conclusion**, **although** raising the legal driving age might prevent some accidents, it is not the best solution. I firmly believe that improved driver education and stricter law enforcement would be far more effective in ensuring road safety.

> **中文翻译:**
> 交通事故是全球关注的主要问题。**人们常建议**提高最低驾驶年龄是改善道路安全的最有效方法。**虽然**我承认年轻司机可能鲁莽，但我认为更好的培训和更严格的惩罚是更有效的解决方案。
>
> **一方面**，提高驾驶年龄可以在**一定程度上**减少事故。**这是因为**年轻人通常比年长的司机更冲动，经验更少。**例如**，统计数据经常显示，20岁以下的司机卷入更多的高速碰撞事故。**因此**，禁止他们上路直到年纪更大可能会挽救生命。
>
> **然而**，仅仅改变年龄限制并不能保证更好的驾驶技术。**在我看来**，缺乏适当的培训是事故的根本原因。**如果**新司机，无论年龄大小，都接受严格的测试，他们在路上会更安全。**例如**，在课程中包括强制性的危险感知测试和夜间驾驶时间将会更有益。**除此之外**，对交通违规行为进行更严格的惩罚将震慑不良驾驶习惯。
>
> **此外**，提高年龄限制对那些需要车辆工作或学习的负责任的年轻人来说是不公平的。**考虑到**公共交通并不总是可靠的，剥夺他们的驾驶权可能会阻碍他们的独立性和职业前景。
>
> **总之**，**尽管**提高法定驾驶年龄可能会防止一些事故，但这不是最好的解决方案。我坚信，改进驾驶员教育和更严格的执法将在确保道路安全方面更加有效。
