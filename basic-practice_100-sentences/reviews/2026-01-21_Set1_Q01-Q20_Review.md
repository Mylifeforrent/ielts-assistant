*   **Comments**: ✅ Good.

### Q2
*   **Your Answer**: The quality of teaching makes a huge difference to students' **acacemic** performance
*   **Correction**: The quality of teaching makes a huge difference to students' **academic** performance.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `acacemic` -> ❌ **Spelling**. **Academic**. (Careless mistake!)

### Q3
*   **Your Answer**: Parents and teachers should make an effort to limit **childern's** screen time
*   **Correction**: Parents and teachers should make an effort to limit **children's** screen time.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `childern's` -> ❌ **Spelling**. **Children's**. (This is a band 4.0 spelling error).

### Q4
*   **Your Answer**: Economic recession results in the **climbing** unemployment rate.
*   **Correction**: Economic recession results in **a rising** (or **a rise in the**) unemployment rate.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `climbing` -> While 'climbing' is used for numbers, phrases like **rising unemployment** or **soaring unemployment** are more standard collocations.
    *   `the ... rate` -> If referencing a general rate, **a** rising unemployment rate is often better, but **the** is acceptable here.

### Q5
*   **Your Answer**: The development of economy needs a young workforce.
*   **Correction**: **Economic development** needs (or **requires**) a young workforce.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `The development of economy` -> Chinglish structure. Native: **Economic development**.
    *   `needs` -> **Requires** is more formal.

### Q6
*   **Your Answer**: People who **have much work** don't have time to rest.
*   **Correction**: People who **have a heavy workload** (or **are overloaded with work**) don't have time to rest.

*   **Correction**: **Cultural** heritage sites are under threat from **urban development**.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `The cultural...` -> ❌ **Article**. General statements (plural) usually don't take 'The'. "Birds fly", not "The birds fly".
    *   `development of cities` -> **Urban development** (Standard Collocation).

### Q9-Q10
*   **Comments**: ✅ Good.

### Q11
*   **Your Answer**: We should take the social and economic **environment** into consideration.
*   **Correction**: We should take the social and economic **context** into consideration.

    *   `environment` -> Not wrong, but **context** (语境/背景) is the precise collocation for this topic.

### Q12
*   **Your Answer**: **The** intensive **planting** has posed a threat to biodiversity.
*   **Correction**: **Intensive farming** poses a threat to biodiversity.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `planting` -> ❌ **Collocation**. We say **Farming** (agriculture), not just planting.

*   **Correction**: **Exposure** to different **cultures** can boost innovation.

    *   `culture` -> Should be plural **cultures** (different ones).

### Q15
*   **Your Answer**: Government should give **a** priority to social welfare, especially health care.
*   **Correction**: **The** government should give **priority** to social welfare...
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `Government` -> Needs 'The' if referring to the institution.
    *   `a priority` -> Idiom: **give priority to** (Uncountable abstract noun here).

### Q16
*   **Your Answer**: Education may hold the key to people's **work aspect**.
*   **Correction**: Education may hold the key to people's **career prospects**.
*   **Analysis**:

*   **Correction**: The use of **fossil fuels** will cause damage to the environment.

## 💡 Coach's Advice
> **Score: 6.0** (Dragging down by Speling and Articles)

你今天的表现像是一个**粗心的 native speaker**。你的语感和词伙大多是对的（比如 break even, under threat, social welfare），但是你的**拼写**和**冠词**错误太多了，这在写作考试中会给考官留下非常不好的第一印象（认为你基础不扎实）。

**Action Plan**:
1.  **Zero-Tolerance Spelling**: 下次练习前，哪怕慢一点，也要检查一遍拼写。`childern` 这种错误绝对不能再犯。
2.  **Article Diet**: 下一组练习中，试着**强制自己减少 "The" 的使用**。特别是句首的抽象名词（Education, Pollution, Globalization），默认不要加 The，除非你特指“那个”。

**Next Drill**:
*   Please fix the errors in this file immediately.
