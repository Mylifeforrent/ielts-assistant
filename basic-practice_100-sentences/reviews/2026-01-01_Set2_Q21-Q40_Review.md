# Meaningful Feedback - Set 2 (Q21-Q40) Correction

> **Review Date**: 2026-01-01
> **Practice Date**: 2026-01-01
> **Overall Score**: 6.5/9.0
> **Summary**: 表现不错！这一组你的词伙使用（Collocations）更加准确了（如 `Intractable problems`, `Sensationalise suffering` 用得很溜）。但是，**单复数和冠词 (Singular/Plural & Articles)** 依然是你目前最大的瓶颈。你会不仅漏掉 `a/an/the`，还经常忘记把可数名词变复数（如 `Company` -> `Companies`）。

## Detailed Analysis

### Q21-Q23
*   **Comments**: ✅ Excellent collocations. `Intractable problems` and `Sensationalise suffering` are band 7+ phrases. Good job taking the hints!

### Q24
*   **Your Answer**: Company should give woman employee with children maternity leave...
*   **Correction**: **Companies** (or **The company**) should give **female employees** with children maternity leave...
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `Company` -> ❌ **Grammar**. Countable noun "Company" cannot stand alone. Use **Companies** (general) or **The company** (specific).
    *   `woman employee` -> **female employees**. "Woman" is a noun, "Female" is the adjective form usually preferred here, or "Women employees".
    *   **Tip**: When making general statements, prefer **Plural nouns without 'the'** (e.g., "Companies should...", "Teachers should...").

### Q25
*   **Your Answer**: Unhealthy habits put people at the risk of illness
*   **Correction**: Unhealthy habits put people **at risk of** illness.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `at the risk` -> ❌ **Fixed Phrase**. The phrase is **at risk of**. (No 'the').

### Q26
*   **Your Answer**: The scholarship can encourage more students to take postgraduate courses
*   **Correction**: **Scholarships** (or **Government grants** as per hint) can encourage more students to take postgraduate courses.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `The scholarship` -> implied a specific one. Better to use Plural General: **Scholarships**.

### Q27
*   **Comments**: ✅ Good.

### Q28
*   **Your Answer**: Legislation should define drunk driving as criminal offence
*   **Correction**: Legislation should define drunk driving as **a** criminal offence.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `criminal offence` -> Countable noun. Needs **a**.

### Q29
*   **Your Answer**: Rural areas provide people with opportunities to escape from the modern stress and noise
*   **Correction**: Rural areas provide people with opportunities to escape from **the stress and noise of modern life** (or simplify: **modern stress and noise** is okay, but `the` is tricky here).
*   **Coach's Note**: Your answer is actually acceptable. Good job.

### Q30
*   **Your Answer**: Population aging force the country to raise the legal retirement age
*   **Correction**: **The ageing population** **forces** the country to raise the **statutory** retirement age.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `Population aging` -> **The ageing population** (Noun phrase often needs 'The' or treated as specific phenomenon).
    *   `force` -> ❌ **S-V Agreement**. Population (singular) **forces**.
    *   `legal` -> Hint suggests **statutory**.

### Q31-Q33
*   **Comments**: ✅ Good structures.

### Q34
*   **Your Answer**: High rise buildings are sometimes considered a blot of landscape/eyesores of the city
*   **Correction**: High-rise buildings are sometimes considered **a blot on the landscape** / **eyesores**.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `blot of` -> **blot on**.

### Q35-Q37
*   **Comments**: ✅ Solid. Q36 `Historical relics` is a good alternative to `Artefacts`.

### Q38
*   **Your Answer**: Some employees are encouraged to break conventions/tradditional rules
*   **Correction**: Some employees are encouraged to break conventions / **traditional** rules.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `tradditional` -> ❌ **Spelling**. **Traditional** (one 'd').

### Q39
*   **Your Answer**: Because of traffic congestion/traffic jam, it takes more time to commute
*   **Correction**: Because of traffic congestion / **traffic jams**, it takes more time to commute.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `traffic jam` -> Countable. **Traffic jams** or **A traffic jam**.

### Q40
*   **Comments**: ✅ Good.

## 📚 Critical Mistakes to Memorize (错题本)

请将以下错误加入 `mistakes_collection.md` 并**当天重写**（重点关注单复数）：

1.  **[Grammar - Plural/General]**:
    *   **Companies** should... (Not *Company should*)
    *   **Scholarships** can... (Not *The scholarship*)
    *   **Traffic jams** (Not *traffic jam*)
2.  **[Grammar - Articles/Fixed Phrases]**:
    *   **At risk of** (Not *at the risk of*)
    *   **A** criminal offence (Not *criminal offence*)
    *   **A** blot **on** the landscape (Not *blot of*)
3.  **[Spelling]**:
    *   **Traditional** (Not *tradditional*)

## 💡 Coach's Advice
> **Score: 6.5**
你的句型越来越稳了，词伙掌握得很快（Review 一次就能记住一些）。
现在的核心任务是：**去除非必要的“The” (De-cluttering)** 和 **建立复数意识**。
*   **Rule of Thumb**: 当你想表达“某类人/某类事”时，首选 **复数不加The** (e.g., Companies, Scholarships, Unhealthy habits).
*   不要让 `Company should` 这种错误再次出现，这是 5.5 分和 6.5 分的分水岭。
