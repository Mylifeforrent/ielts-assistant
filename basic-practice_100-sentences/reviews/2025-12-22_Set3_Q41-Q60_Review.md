## Detailed Analysis

### Q41
*   **Your Answer**: most envionmental damage can be attributed to human activities
*   **Correction**: **Most** **environmental** damage can be attributed to human activities.
*   **Analysis**:

    *   `most` -> **Most** (Capitalize sentence start).

### Q42
*   **Your Answer**: a large number of children are exposed to violent context
*   **Correction**: **A** large number of children are exposed to violent **content**.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `context` (语境/上下文) vs **content** (内容)。题目是“暴力内容”。
    *   Capitalization!

### Q43
*   **Your Answer**: home environment are considered the most significant influence factor in children's growth
*   **Correction**: **The** home environment **is** considered the most significant **factor** (or **factor influencing**) in children's growth.

    *   `home environment` (单数) -> **is** considered (主谓一致错误!).
    *   `influence factor` -> Chinglish. Use **factor** or **influencing factor**.

### Q44
*   **Your Answer**: with more and more young people participanting in voluneer work,the cohesion of the community will be enhanced
*   **Correction**: With more and more young people **participating** in **volunteer** work, **community cohesion** will be enhanced.
*   **Comments**: 
    *   🚫 **Spelling Disaster**: *participanting* (多写了t), *voluneer* (少写了t). 这种错误在考试中很致命。

### Q45
*   **Your Answer**: migration is considered the threat to social solidarity
*   **Correction**: **Migration** is considered **a** threat to social **cohesion** (or solidarity).

*   **Correction**: **Young** people without a college degree can only **find** (or **secure**) low-skilled jobs.

*   **Correction**: In **a** competitive society, **working adults** (or **people with jobs**) usually **care about** their career.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `have a work` -> ❌ Wrong. Work is uncountable. Say **have a job** or **are working**.

### Q52
*   **Your Answer**: animal experiments sometimes are unable to detect the side effect of the medicine
*   **Correction**: **Animal** experiments are sometimes unable to detect the **side effects** of **drugs** (or medicines).

### Q53
*   **Your Answer**: illegal hunting caused some animals poaching
*   **Correction**: Illegal hunting **has led to the extinction of some animals**.
*   **Critical Fault**:
    *   题目是“导致某些动物的**灭亡**”。

    *   **Extinction** 是本题的核心词。

### Q54
*   **Your Answer**: the influence on communication skills caused by computer vary across ages
*   **Correction**: The influence of **computers** on communication skills **varies** across ages.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `computer` (单数) -> **computers** (复数泛指).
    *   `influence ... vary` -> **varies** (主语 influence 是单数 -> 动词用三单).

### Q55
*   **Your Answer**: a large number of girls aren't willing to find jobs in male-dominated world
*   **Correction**: A large number of girls are **reluctant** to **seek employment** in **a** male-dominated world.

### Q58
*   **Correction**: ... **are unlikely to** hire new employees. (Your version is acceptable but *unlikely* fits "不可能" better in formal writing).

### Q59
*   **Your Answer**: air transport may cause many greenhouse gases
*   **Correction**: Air transport may **generate** (or **produce**) **large quantities of** greenhouse gases.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `cause gases` -> **produce/generate** gases.
    *   `many gases` -> **large amounts of** gases.

### Q60
*   **Your Answer**: it's very possible that children have behavioural problems
*   **Correction**: Children **are likely to** have (or **suffer from**) behavioural problems.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   `It's very possible that...` -> Grammatically correct but wordy. `Subject + be likely to` is more idiomatic.
